# Meatballs

* Serves: 4
* Prep Time: 30 minutes
* Cook Time: 40 minutes

I have loved spaghetti and meatballs since I can remember.  I love the different variates you can find from the Swedish infamous Ikea meatballs to Turkey's Kofta - everyone has their own take on the meatball. My partners family has a wonderful Bosnian recipe so I thought it was time I had my own. 
During my quest to conquer the greatest meatball recipe I discovered the French Guy Cooking (Alex) on YouTube. His meatball series in incredible and Alex takes the meatball recipe to another level. While Alex's recipe truly does result in the most perfect meatball there were some things that I do differently. So this is my take on his perfect meatballs. In Alex's meatball series he points out 50% of the meatball is meat so it is really important to get blend of meat right.

## Ingredients
* 600g best butches ground beef - 300g/50% marbled short ribs (fatty), 240g/40% rib eye cap, dry aged (strong flavour) and 60g/10% beef fat
* 2 shallots, finely diced
* 2 red onion, finely diced
* 2 garlic cloves, grated
* 50g flat leaf parsley, chopped (keep some back for serving)
* 50g parmesan cheese, grated (keep some back for serving)
* 2tsp fresh basil, chopped
* ? 1tbsp of grated zucchini flesh (white only)
* 2tsp cumin
* 1tsp cinnamon
* 2tsp herbs de provence
* 2tsp oregano
* 2tsp smoked paprika
* 1 eggs
* 2 slices of stale bread, soaked in whole milk (stale day old bread with no crust work best)
* 2tbsp cream cheese
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Butter

## Spaghetti Sauce
* 2 shallots
* 1 garlic
* 2tbsp tomato puree
* 1tsp dried basil
* 1 can chopped tomatoes
* 2tbsp balsamic vinegar

## Method

* Preheat the oven to 220°C
* Cook off the onions and garlic in some butter and set aside to cool.
* Once cool, mix the beef, eggs and onions together in a bowl.
* Combine the dried herbs, parsley, breadcrumbs, parmesan and cream cheese and continue to mix into a pate.
* With wet hands roll into golf-ball like sized balls and place on a baking tray.
* Optionally brown off the meatballs in a pan to give them a crispy edge - I don't as I prefer a softer meatball.
* Cook the meatballs in the pre-heated oven for 18 minutes. No opening to peek but don't over cook them. Remember we want a moist centre.
* While the meatballs are cooking prepare your sauce or gravy and your mash or spaghetti.

** Spaghetti and sauce
* For the sauce, cook off the remaining onions and garlic in some butter. 
* Once the onions have browned off, add the tomato puree and basil and cook for a further 3 minutes.
* Add the can of tomatoes and balsamic vinegar and simmer to reduce for 15 minutes.

** Gravy and mash
I will add this the next time I serve with mash (berries and gravy).

* As Alex says in his series - don't soak the meatballs in the sauce while it is cooking. Cook the two separately and bring together when serving.
* Serve with some grated parmesan cheese and wait for that moment when you cut into the first meatball and discover how moist they are.
