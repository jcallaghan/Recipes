Method
Beans are magical little things and massively underrated. I’m showing them some love by pairing them with exciting Mexican flavours. Baked in a tortilla with veg and cheese until golden on the outside, but oozy on the inside, it’s a real texture extravaganza. Beans are an amazing veggie source of protein and are packed with fibre, which will keep you nice and full. They also count as one of your 5-a-day, so this recipe clocks up up two of your 5-a-day! Use any leftover beans and tomatoes to make some homemade baked beans – add a pinch of paprika for a smoky kick.
Preheat the oven to 180°C/350°F/ gas 4. Peel and finely slice the onion, then deseed and slice up the pepper. Coarsely grate the cheese.
Heat a little oil in a frying pan over a medium-low heat and gently fry the onion for 10 minutes, or until softened.
Peel and crush the garlic, then add to the pan along with the chilli powder.
Add the tomato purée and the tomatoes, breaking them up with a spoon as you go, then drain and add the kidney beans.
Cook for 10 minutes, or until slightly reduced, then season to taste with sea salt and black pepper.
In a separate pan, fry the pepper in a little oil until starting to soften, then set aside.
Divide the filling mixture in half, then blitz one half with a stick blender to form a bean paste – if you don’t have a stick blender, mash with a potato masher.
Spread the tortillas with the warm bean paste, then add a serving spoon of the filling and sprinkle with cheese. Roll up the tortillas and place on greased baking tins.
Bake for 5 to 10 minutes, or until golden and warmed through.
Dress the salad leaves in a little oil and vinegar, then serve alongside your bean wraps.
