* 1 onion, finely chopped
* 2 garlic cloves, crushed
* 2 tsp herbs de provence
* 1 tsp chilli flakes
* 1 tsp smoked paprika
* 1 tsp rosemary
* 2 tbsp of tomato puree
* 1 can of chopped tomatoes
* 1 tsp dijon mustard

4. Add all the herbs (except the nutmeg), mustard, sugar, cheese, chicken stock, parsley and tomato puree
5. Mix in the can of chopped tomatoes (and option cherry tomatoes), 
drained pasta and mix together before adding to an over proof dish (a larger dish allows for a larger crispier top)

7. Remove the dish from the oven and add the cheese kept back for the topping, sprinkle with the nutmeg and sea salt flakes
8. Return to the oven and cook at 200°C for a further 10 minutes until the top is crispy
