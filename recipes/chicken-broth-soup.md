# Chicken Broth Soup

* Serves: 4
* Prep Time: 20 minutes
* Cook Time: 3 hours

My take on a classic. This recipe is inspired by a close family friend (her special jewish recipe) and a bosnian variation. 
It is a trusted favourite when I'm feeling poorly or unwell. Best served with semolina dumplings however I'm still perfecting these.
If there is any leftover I drain and remove any remaining chicken (freeze for pie mix) and discard any veg. This leaves a delicate chicken broth for lunch the following day.

## Ingredients:
* 2 onions, halved and skin on
* 4 large carrots, quartered and skin on
* 4 celery sticks, halved
* 4 garlic cloves, squashed
* Salt and pepper to taste
* Chicken stock cube
* Whole free-range corn fed chicken

## Method:
1. Add the onions, carrots, celery and garlic to the pan
2. Add the whole chicken
3. Fill the pan with water and add the chicken stock Bring to a boil and then simmer for 1 1/2 hours
4. Skim the fat and any foam from the top into a dish (this fat is great to keep refrigerated and use to cook with roast potatoes)
5. Drain over sieve into another pan
6. Place the veg and chicken to one side and return the broth back to the original pan
7. Separate and chop the carrots and discard the rest of the vegetables
8. Remove the chicken from the carcass carefully removing all the bones and skin
9. Add the bones back to the broth and simmer for a further hour
10. Continue to skim any fat or foam to create a delicate and clear broth
11. If serving with dumplings then add them approximately 20 minutes ahead of serving
12. Before serving add the chicken and carrots back to the broth
