# Chicken Broth Soup

- Serves: 4
- Prep Time: 20 minutes
- Cook Time: 3 hours

My take on a classic. This recipe is inspired by a close family friend (her special jewish recipe) and a bosnian variation. 
It is a trusted favourite when I'm feeling poorly or unwell. Best served with semolina dumplings however I'm still perfecting these.
If there is any leftover I drain and remove any remaining chicken (freeze for pie mix) and discard any veg. This leaves a delicate chicken broth for lunch the following day.

## Ingredients:
- 2 onions, halved and skin on
- 4 large carrots, quartered and skin on
- 4 celery sticks, halved
- 4 garlic cloves, squashed
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Chicken stock cube
- Whole free-range corn fed chicken

## Method:
- Add the onions, carrots, celery and garlic to the pan
- Add the whole chicken
- Fill the pan with water and add the chicken stock
- Bring to a boil and then simmer for 1 1/2 hours
- Skim the fat and any foam from the top into a dish (this fat is great to keep refrigerated and use to cook with roast potatoes)
- Drain over sieve into another pan
- Place the veg and chicken to one side and return the broth back to the original pan
- Separate and chop the carrots and discard the rest of the vegetables
- Remove the chicken from the carcass carefully removing all the bones and skin
- Add the bones back to the broth and simmer for a further hour
- Continue to skim any fat or foam to create a delicate and clear broth
- If serving with dumplings then add them approximately 20 minutes ahead of serving
- Before serving add the chicken and carrots back to the broth
