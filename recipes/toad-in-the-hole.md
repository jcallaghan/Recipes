# Toad in the hole

* Serves: 3
* Prep Time: 15 minutes
* Cook Time: 25 minutes

This is a very classic British dish and simply classic. For the best results make the batter ahead of time and place it in the fridge for a few hours so when it hits the smokin hot oil. This creates the best crispy batter.

## Ingredients:
* 6 best butchers sausages (I love using big cumberlands)
* 2 eggs
* 75g flour
* 75ml milk
* 1 tbsp mustard powder
* 1 tsp smoked paprika
* 150ml beef gravy stock
* 2 large white onions
* 100ml red wine
* Garden peas
* Fresh rosemary
* Cooking oil

## Method:
1. Preheat the over to 225Â°C
2. Brown off the sausages in a frying pan
3. While the sausages are browning, add 3-4 tbsp of oil to a casserole dish and add to the oven to get it smoking hot
4. Prepare the batter by mixing the eggs and flour together
5. Add the milk, mustard powder, paprika and seasoning to taste
6. Remove the casserole dish from the oven (ensure it goes on a heat proof surface)
7. Quickly place the sausages to the dish before pouring the batter around the sizzling hot tray and topping with rosemary
8. Return back to the oven for 25 minutes
9. The trick for a cripsy batter is to not open the oven until the batter is cooked
10. Finely chop the onion and add to a pan with oil or butter to sweat off
11. Keep stirring them to prevent them from burning
12. Once the onions have caramelised, add some flour and mix around and then reduce the red wine in a pan
14. Add the gravy and bring to a simmer
15. Ahead of serving bring water in a pan to a boil to cook the peas
16. Mix in a few splashes of balsamiq vinegar to the gravy
17. Serve with gravy and peas
