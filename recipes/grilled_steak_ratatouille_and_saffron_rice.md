# Grilled steak ratatouille and saffron rice

* Serves: 2
* Prep Time: 15 minutes
* Cook Time: 45 minutes

This is an instant winner with friends. The ratatouille is full of flavour, particularly if you chargrill the courgette and aubergine sufficiently. It is also a great dish to present at a dinner party and the steak can be combined or swapped out with vegetarian options. It is full of colour and aromatic smells.
