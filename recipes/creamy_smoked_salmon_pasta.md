# Creamy smoked salmon pasta

* Serves: 2
* Prep Time: 5 minutes
* Cook Time: 20 minutes

Smoked salmon, one of my favourite fishes.
Apparently I perfected this recipe. Possible thanks to my brother, who after speaking with while I was last cooking suggested I add a couple of teaspoons of whole grain mustard. 
This recipe is also known as Farfalle al salmone.
