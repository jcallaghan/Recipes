# Thai Green Curry

- Serves: 4
- Prep Time: 10 minutes
- Cook Time: 30 minutes

I remember the first time I had a prawn thai green curry like it was yesterday. With this recipe I'm instantly taken back to the [The Wrestlers](https://www.squaremeal.co.uk/restaurants/the-wrestlers-cambridge_8507) on Newmarket Road in Cambridge. A team of us from the IT department at Marshall Aerospace regularly visitied for lunch at least once a month! For me I'm reminded of the intensity of the curry paste and chilli's, the sweetness and smoothness of the coconut milk, stickiness of the rice served seperately in a bowl and the aubergine that has stuck with me since. They also provided chilli prawn crackers with the dish which were delicious.

Among the countless recipes i've tried this is the one I default to each time I cook a thai green curry. I like it hot but you can make it as hot or mild as you like. Some like it with prawns while others like it with chicken. This and my katsu curry recipe inspired me to track down a utensil that I have seen used in restaurants like Wagamama among others to mould the stick rice as it is served. After much research I finally found the name of the utensil. It is known as a Shimotori (Omurice) rice mold and I found one sold by [Global Kitchen Japan](https://www.globalkitchenjapan.com/collections/shimotori/products/shimotori-stainless-steel-restaurant-style-rice-mold-omurice). This adds a lovely little touch to the dish when it is served.

# Ingredients:
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 2 tbsp peanut oil
- 1 tbsp green curry paste
- 2 tbsp fish sauce
- 1 can coconut milk
- 4 kaffir lime leaves
- 1 tbsp palm sugar
- Red chillis to taste
- Juice of 1 lime
- Â½ teaspoon zest of kaffir or ordinary lime
- 8 thai basil leaves
- Sliced aubergine
- 1 small can of bamboo shoots drained
- 600g king prawns, shelled
- Optionally 2 x chicken breasts or thighs
- Sticky rice
- Prawn crackers

## Method:
1. Heat the oils in a large heavy bottom pan and stir in the curry paste for 1-2 minutes. Careful the heat is not too hot that it burns the curry paste.
1. Add the coconut milk, lime leaves, palm sugar, fish sauce, lime juice, zest and simmer for 10-15 minutes. This is the points where you can add more green curry paste or coconut milk depending on your preference. If I add more of both I often add a little more palm sugar and lime.
1. Complete the sauce by adding the chilli's, aubergine and bamboo shoots.
1. Boil water and add sticky rice following instructions as per sticky rice cooking guidance.
1. In a seperate pan cook the prawns or chicken breast. Once cooked cut the chicken into slices.
1. Throw in the torn thai basil leaves and stir.
1. Serve the sticky rice (seperately or using the Shimotori mold) before placing the prawn or chicken over the rice or in a bowl.
1. Pour the curry over the prawn or chicken.
