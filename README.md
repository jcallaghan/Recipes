# I'm not a chef, I'm a geek who loves to cook great food.

## Recipes
This is a plan text (well markdown) archive of all my favourite food and drink recipes.

### Background
For years I have snipped and saved recipes I come across and use. I have old written recipes, recipes saved in OneNote, recipes I have written blog articles about but I've never created a single archive of my recipes, from the staple week night dishes to challenging dishses I test myself when hosting dinner parties. The main challenge is being able to find, search and explore my all my recipes really easily.

### Why Github
As I have lots of recipes I thought using GitHub just like I would with code was an ideal way to store the content to use and ultimately share. The entire repo is public so my recipes are easy to share. I can pull them up really easily using the GitHub app on my phone. I'm able to leverage the issues feature to track recipes I want to try and is somewhere to store the vast research I can go into when exploring a dish. 

The goal is to not get caught up formating the recipes and instead write them with basic formating. This is because I want to learn more about Jekyll and Github pages. This will allow me to send a recipe from this repo to my blog for example and the formatting and styling done consistenly for me automatically. I also hope to integrate the recipes with Microsoft Search and Alexa so I can find and access them more easily on my Echo Show in the kitchen. I'll keep you updated with how I progress with all of this.
