# Recipes
This is a plan text archive of all my favourite food recipes.

## Why Github
I want to learn more about Jekyll and Github pages. As I have lots of recipes I thought this was ideal content to use and ultimately share. I also hope to integrate the recipes with Microsoft Search and Alexa so I can find and access them more easily. I'll keep you updated with how I progress with all of this.
