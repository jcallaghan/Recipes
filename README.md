# I'm not a chef, I'm a geek who loves to cook great food.

## Recipes
This is a plan text (well markdown) archive of all my favourite food and drink recipes.

### Background
For years I have snipped and saved recipes I come across and use. I have old written recipes, recipes saved in OneNote, as well has written blog articles about my recipes but I've never created a single archive of my recipes, from the staple week night dishes to challenging dishses I test myself when hosting dinner parties. The main challenge is being able to find, search and explore my all my recipes really easily.

### Why Github
As I have lots of recipes I thought using GitHub just like I would with code was an ideal way to store the content to use and ultimately share. The entire repo is public so my recipes are easy to share and others to see the research that I put into my food. I can pull them up really easily using the GitHub app on my phone or more often then not use my Surface. I'm able to leverage the issues feature to track recipes I want to try and it is a great place to store the vast research I can go into when exploring a particular dish. I also exploit the label feature alongside issues to easily categorise my receipes which helps a lot when doing my weekly meal plan.

### The geeky chef

The goal is to not get caught up with the formating of the recipes and instead write them in markdown. This is because I want to learn more about Jekyll and Github pages. This will allow me to send a recipe from this repo to my blog for example and the formatting and styling will be applied consistenly for me automatically. I also hope to integrate the recipes with Microsoft Search and Alexa so I can find and access them more easily on my Echo Show in the kitchen. Another benefit to storing my recipes in this repo and the background research is that I can tie this into my Smart Home automation using Home Assistant which integrates my meal plan into my calendar and reminds me if I need to defrost ingredients from the freezer and helps with my online food shop order. 

### Made with love

I'll keep you updated with how I progress with all the geeky stuff but for now enjoy my recipes and take a peek at some of the food I like to cook that I'm currently tracking through issues.
